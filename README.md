This is a modpack for **Yairm's Unciv**, introducing 4 new unique civilizations with their own unique units and play styles.
## Civilizations:
### Angaria
* Along the arid steppes, the Angarians live off the land under harsh circumstances. As hard conditions breed hardier peoples, the Angarians soon found themselves the superior of their neighbours in horsemanship and prowess in combat.

  * Unique Unit: Raydiar
  >Mounting the strong horses, bred with powerful thunderthighs and super-equine endurance, the Raydiars are fierce raiders that can square up to even the most formidable cavaliers of the world. Mighty beasts of burden are coupled with burly, brazen warriors, producing cavalrymen of a remarkable variety.

  * Unique Building: Horse Byre
  >The Horse Byres of Angaria are famed for the techniques involved in it's creation, and it's capability to hold even the most rowdiest and wildest of horses and mules. These byres are equipped and readied for an experienced huntsman to start taming and/or milking the beast that the structure holds within without much hassle.

### Kursa
* Not all were made to live in the deserts, and the Kursa were one of those peoples who have decided so that mayhaps an endless ocean is better than a barrenscape of sand and sandstone. Led by devotion to their meritocratic captains and their free-spiring religion, the Kursa make a living in rampant piracy and coastal raiding.

  * Unique Unit: Corsair
  >Whether they be mercenaries for hire, or freshbloods from the bowels of ship sterns. The Corsairs of Kursa were not really much of a fighting force, but more of a scouting and pillaging group for the society that produces them. Not meant obviously for inland incursions or as a standing army (except for the most rugged generals), but the Corsairs can hold their own.
  
  * Unique Unit: Xebec
  >Fast and agile, masted ships built with Kursai bark that is much more durable than it seems; the Xebecs are made exactly tempered to their profession, they can catch up to almost any naval vessel on the sea, and deliver cunning, fatal blows. Although they are not the most ideal under defensive circumstances.

### Pezantia
* Born from a revolution long past, with a history of resisting oppression and autocratic tyranny; the peoples of Pezantia are a free, peace-loving and simple culture living under rurality and common association. Although, don't let their serene atmosphere fool the average empire, they are willing to defend their independence if need be, although this is not usually their strongest suit.

  * Unique Unit: Boar Rider
  >The lack of readily available horse and manpower trained to create cavalry, along with the common conception that the idea of Knights is remnant of that of tyrannical monarchies and crushing hierarchy; the Boar Riders replaced much of what would become the mounted forces of Pezantia. They are not as mobile as the average knight, but they make up for it with ferocity and fervour, especially if the enemy is running away from the famed "Boar Charge".
  
  * Unique Building: Town Center
  >Located in the middle of villages and small cities of Pezantia, can be found the Town Centers. Not lavishly decorated, nor extravagantly made from fanciful resources (some are made from straws and mudbricks), the populace of the locality gathers in nonetheless to discuss monthly quotas, the status of the crops and the future of the community; offering a sense of familial wholeness, unity and exceptional social organization.
  
### Xenshi
* Unlike their more tranquil cousins, the Xenshi are the active of the monks and priests that have chosen to live in the highlands of the world. Teaching their arts to any who would hear them, and martial prowess to those that would join them. They are a nation who lives under conditions of peace, but are not afraid of the opposite situation.

  * Unique Building: Tigershrine
  >Disregarding currency as malevolent, it is to no surprise that banks and such investing estates are not dotting the Xenshi homelands. Rather, Tigershrines are the more culturally remarkable piece of their nation. Built into each commune once it grows large enough; Tigershrines are places of worship and prosthesis, where the lowest-ranking to the highest leaders of the order goto and perform their meditational routines.
 
  * Unique Improvement: High Temple
  >Once a Xenshi master is wise enough, he or she can set out to construct a High Temple across the lands of the Order. At first these would be minor places of humble homes and worship, but can grow large enough to be small congregational extensions of the commune that it spawned from, producing employment to maintain it and a place for youngsters to educate themselves in it's history and the schools of thought that it belongs to. It is also seldomly used as the first frontline of defense against foreign incursions into the Xenshi highlands.
